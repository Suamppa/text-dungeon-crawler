# text-dungeon-crawler
Practice project based on and extended from the project created during the Zenva Academy course "Learn C++ by Making a Text-Based RPG [2020]".

This branch is in development and contains prototyping for a proper dungeon generation and navigation functionalities.

Some planned features:
- Proper procedural room and dungeon generation (in dev)
- Less horrid dungeon navigation function (in dev)
- Proper inventory and equip systems
- More enemies
- Loot system, removal of enemy-or-chest exclusivity
