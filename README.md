# text-dungeon-crawler
Practice project based on and extended from the project created during the Zenva Academy course "Learn C++ by Making a Text-Based RPG [2020]".

The branch "master" holds the latest stable version with no in-dev prototypes.
In contrast, the original course project had just 4 hardcoded rooms and no RNG features. The original code as it was at the end of the course is not included in any of these versions uploaded to GitHub.

Some planned features:
- Proper inventory and equip systems
- More enemies
- Loot system, removal of enemy-or-chest exclusivity

# Compiling
For compiling I recommend using C++20 or newer, but some versions may still compile with older standards.
